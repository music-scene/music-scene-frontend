# MusicScene Client

## Description

Welcome to **MusicScene**, your guide to live music!

For our third project, we have created a **Full-stack SPA** using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.JS). 

This is the Frontend repo. You can find the Backend repo [here](https://github.com/music-scene/music-scene-backend)

## Instructions

To be able to run this on your computer, first clone the repo:

```
git clone <repo url>
```

Create a .env file in your project folder and add the following:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5005
```

Then run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```
To run and test the application, the command is:

```
npm run dev
```
