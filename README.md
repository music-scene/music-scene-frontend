# MusicScene Client


## Description

Welcome to **MusicScene**, your guide to live music!

- For our third project, we have created a **Full-stack Application** using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Mongoose and React). 

- This is the Frontend repository for the **SPA** built with **React**. A repository with the backend (REST API) can be found here [here](https://github.com/music-scene/music-scene-backend)

## Instructions

To be able to run this on your computer, first clone the repo:

```
git clone <repo url>
```

Create a .env file in your project folder and add the following environment variable:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5005
```

Then run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```
To run and test the application, the command is:

```
npm run dev
```
